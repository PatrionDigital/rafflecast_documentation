# 4. Prize Distribution

This page will describe how prizes are distributed to the winners:

• On-chain and Off-chain Prizes: Explanation of the different types of prizes and how they are distributed.

• Rewarding Winners: The process by which prizes are automatically sent to the winner once the raffle closes.

## Prize Categories



## Reward Process

In principle, rewards should follow a "pull" process model; rather than sending out the prize itself, winners are directed to a "claim page" where they can retrieve their prize.

From a security standpoint this has some advantages; if the user loses control of the receiving wallet, or has mistakenly input an incorrect address, then the prize is not iretrievably sent to the wrong destination; if there is fraud or other malfeasance found, the claim page can be deactivated.

### Alpha/Beta Version Process

For onchain rewards, particularly for the proof-of-concept phase of the project, we'll be using the [Mint.Fun](https://mint.fun) system on the Base rollup.
