# 3. Workflows - Entry Weights

## Discussion

The most common way I've seen this implemented is by giving Entrants extra Entries by fulfilling other conditions. i.e. Instead of putting all Criteria into a single grouping, spread different groups of Criteria into individual fullfillment batches.

The other implementation is by increasing the number of Points the Entrant can earn and apply to their Entry to give it a greater "weight".

The first method is probably the most easy to understand on the part of the Entrants, and the most customizable for Creators.
