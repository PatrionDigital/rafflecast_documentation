# Initial Application Proposal

## Introduction

RaffleCast is an on-chain raffle tool designed for Warpcast, addressing the “Contents” theme of Fracton Ventures’ 2024 incubation program.

Inspired by the now-defunct “Twitter Picker,” RaffleCast reimagines social engagement tools for the Web3 era, aligning with Ethereum principles of openness, decentralization, and composability.

The project is committed to being a Public Good for the Ethereum ecosystem, prioritising accessibility, interoperability, and collaboration.

## Problem Statement

Centralized platforms like Twitter/X have proven unreliable for third-party developers, often restricting access or shutting down popular tools.

Meanwhile, most Web3 games lack robust, integrated social layers—or worse, suffer from fragmented communities that have little connection and are destined to remain isolated.

This fragmentation stifles collaboration, limits engagement, and prevents communities from realising their full potential.

## Proposed Solution

RaffleCast empowers developers, influencers, and creators to seamlessly conduct verifiable raffles on Warpcast, the leading Web3 social protocol. The tool is:

* Credibly Neutral: Ensures fairness and transparency through on-chain verification.
* Open Access: Fully decentralized, enabling unrestricted use by all.
* Composable: Built to integrate with Warpcast and beyond, enhancing functionality across apps and games.
* Scalable for Adoption: Designed to drive Warpcast adoption by providing practical, real-world utilities for games, influencers, and communities.

Decentralized Web3 social platforms like Warpcast give individuals control of their social graphs, enabling true ownership and portability of connections. This eliminates the need for manual “porting” of user communities across games or applications. Instead, communities naturally overlap through inherent network effects, fostering collaboration and strengthening bonds between otherwise isolated groups.

By committing to open-source development and aligning with Ethereum’s principles, RaffleCast ensures it will remain a shared resource for the ecosystem, encouraging broad integration and driving the adoption of decentralized social tools.

## Projected Applications

* In-Game Raffles: Enhance player engagement through fair, event-based rewards.
* Influencer Campaigns: Enable targeted campaigns by cross-referencing player activity with social graphs.
* Community-Building: Facilitate raffles for token holders, event participants, and DAO members.
* Cross-Industry Use Cases: Expand beyond gaming, supporting a variety of Web3-native communities and applications.

## Ethereum Alignment

RaffleCast adheres to the Ethereum ecosystem’s foundational principles:

* Open Source: Public code ensures transparency and fosters collaboration.
* Open Standards: Built to Warpcast’s protocol specifications for compatibility and longevity.
* Decentralized and Secure: Fully on-chain, with no reliance on centralized services.
* Positive Sum: Encourages growth across the Ethereum and Web3 ecosystems by integrating with multiple platforms.
